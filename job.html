        <p>
            My dream job is not so much about the company as it is about
            work place enviroment. It is much more important for me to have
            good coleagues and interesting work assignements. To be able
            to look forward to each day, and not long for the weekend, is 
            very important.

            When it comes to actual work, I have good experience working with
            local schools, and to be able to work wiht project for education
            would be very interesting. I`m also an active gamer, and working
            with computer games ore platforms is something I would be interested
            in.
